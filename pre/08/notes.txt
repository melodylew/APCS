We didn't really have trouble with most of these. We just did them through trial and errors. CodingBat really helped when it ran different test cases to see if our code worked for different cases. I had some trouble with sum28 and scoresIncreasing, but developing an algorithm beforehand and running tests helped me with my final code.
