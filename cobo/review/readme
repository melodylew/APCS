Summary of Experience:

Throughout this lab, we learned to data processing on .txt files which inputs
a series of Strings.
* Activity 1 goes through the basics of "evaluating" Strings by using the
assigning values of each word in cleanSentiment.csv.
* Activity 2 introduces the processing of reviews in the form of .txt files, in
which .txt files are converted to String and processed iteratively.
* Activity 3 explored the random modification of data in SimpleReview.txt.
* Activity 4 explored the intended modification of data in SimpleReview.txt.
* Activity 5 allowed us to freely apply these skills, which led us to coding a
simple word game, Wordle. 

From these activities, our understanding of manipulating file inputs with Java
code is greater. We reviewed methods from the String class such as
subString() and indexOf(). In addition, we practiced using the try-catch
functions in Review.java. The lab was overall a great reminder of previously
learned skills.
