Coach Christopher Mykolyk keeps at this gig because his *industrious, *insightful, insatiably *curious students inspire him daily. Grateful for the *life-shaping guidance, wisdom, inspiration and encouragement provided by his *best teachers, he aims to pass along something in kind. Fueled by *good beats, coffee and art, he revels in the *frenzied feast of NYC, the zen of *fruitful labor, and seeing his students exceed their own expectations.
