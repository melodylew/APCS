ACTIVITY 1: Introduction (Reviews and Sentiment Value)

1a. public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b. sentimentVal() requires a String parameter. If you pass a different type of
parameter, there will be a compile error stating that the types are incompatible.
1c. The method returns a double.

2.
Method Call                     || Return Value
===============================================================
sentimentVal("hello");             0.75
sentimentVal("awesome");           0.92
sentimentVal("peers");             0.5

3a. This statement will compile because "warm" is a single String and
sentimentVal() takes in single String parameters.
3b. This statement will not compile because 0.5 is a double and not a String type.
3c. This statement will not compile because "good" and "bad" are two Strings
and sentimentVal() only takes in one String.

3. indexOf() returns the index of a character in a String. substring() returns
part of a String, beginning from the specified start index up to the specified
end index. These methods can be used to divide a string into two parts by finding
the index of the character you want to split at and creating two separate 
substrings. The first substring will have all the characters from the first character
up until the character at the specified index. The second substring will contain
the rest of the characters of the original string.
