DISCO:
0. You can pass an object into ArrayList.remove() and it will that object from
the ArrayList if it's present.
1. Even though you create frame components, you must explicitly add them to the
frame (took a while to figure out)
2. Separating your game logic from your GUI makes it much more straightforward
to focus on issues/errors with either one at a time. This is especially
important because the Java swing set is hard to work with.

QCC:
0. How can we fix/reset the timer?


ACTIVITY 2

1. The purpose of a constructor is to instantiate instance variables.
2. It will always start with public followed by the class name. It can also take parameters.
3. String clue and String answer
4. Getters and setters for the clue and answer instance variables
7. An additional constructor could be:

public Celebrity() {

}

The difference is that the answer and clue instance variables will have to be set later with the setters methods.



ACTIVITY 3

1. The JComponent class' appearance can be modified with setForeground(), setBackground().
JComponents can be added to Layouts which can be added to JFrames.
2. private ArrayList<Celebrity> _celebGameList;
3. private
12. CelebrityGame
13. Nothing
