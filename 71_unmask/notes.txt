DISCO
- Our "hypotheses" works only when c is equal to or less than 2.
- The order of the elements to either side of c does not matter in regards to
order.
- This pattern only keeps up until c is greater than 2.

QCC
- If our hypotheses is correct, why doesn't it work when c is greater than 2?

q0: What does it do?
a0: create a partition at "c" where every value to the left of "c" is less than
"c" and every value to the right of "c" is greater than "c"

q1: O(?)
a1: O(n) because we are running through one for-loop, hence the outcome will be
linear to the input.


Hypotheses:
- possible values of a box plot?????????????????????????????????????????
- creating a partition at "c" where every value to the left of "c" is less than
"c" and every value to the right of "c" is greater than "c"
